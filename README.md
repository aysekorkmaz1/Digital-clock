<h1> DÄ°GÄ°TAL CLOCK</h1>

This time, I've completed a simple digital clock project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a real-time updating digital clock.
ðŸš€ Project Features:
A dynamic digital clock interface updating hours, minutes, and seconds.
JavaScript is used for time formatting, ensuring a clean display of hours, minutes, and seconds.
An audible ticking clock sound for feedback.
